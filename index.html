      <h2>Assignment 3</h2>
        <p>Javascript is a confusing language. Combine what with html and it creates many hair pulling situations. I was happy to be able to get every part done for this assignment. The hardest part for me was implementing the “add twit.” Having to copy every part of the html article “twit” in javascript was both tedious, and easy to make an error. I was able to utilize the console in the developer view to figure out most errors, but oftentimes the error message was very vague so debugging was hard. I was surprised by how quickly I implemented the search function. It took a bit for me to get it to include both the author and message, but it turned out to be an error in logic. I was using an “or” statement instead of an “and” so it hid it if one or the other did not contain the phrase.</p>

        <p>Some helpful resources were Geeks for Geeks, Stack Exchange, W3-schools, and the example code from lectures for reminders on syntax.</p>
