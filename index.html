      <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
        <p>This was a surprisingly difficult assignment for me. There felt like
        so many options for how to do everything that I spent a lot of time trying
        to figure out the "best" one. I think that the hardest part for me was
        getting the twits lined up so there were only 3 and that they did not go
        past a certain size. At first I used a flex box, but I could not figure
        out how to have a max of 3 twits in a row. So I ended up using grid and
        setting it to 3 columns then when the page was shrunk down to 1000px, it
        would make 2 columns. </p>

        <p>The most useful resource (aside from lectures) was
        https://www.w3schools.com/css. They had tons of info and various methods
        I could use to accomplish tasks. It was very helpful for the navbar as
        I couldn't figure out how to center the text in the bar.
