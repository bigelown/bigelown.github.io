      <h2>Assignment 5</h2>
        <p>Something about javascript syntax is very unintuitive for me. Nearly all of my problems came from syntax errors. I was always on the right track and a few times was literally a “{}” away from having it correct, but the lack of a clear error log made debugging extremely difficult. I spent at least 5 hours just trying to figure out why my page was not rendering using my main.handlebars as the default layout, only to realize that it was because index.html caused a conflict. The next issue that I ran into was displaying the twit of the specified index. Which after a few hours I found out that it was the difference between “res.status(200).render('twitContainer', {singleTwit})” and “res.status(200).render('twitContainer', singleTwit)”. </p>
        <br></br>
        <p>I learned from these assignments that I am going to be avoiding javascript in the future if I can help it.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Aside from the official handlebars documentation, I could not find any external resources that were helpful. The demo code from lectures was useful and re-watching the lectures was good, but the most useful resource was Campus Wire.</p>
        <br></br>
        <p>Google Searches (the few I found in history):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>handlebars render multiple partials</li>
          <li>handlebars each specific index</li>
          <li>Handlebars not rendering default layout</li>
        </ul>
