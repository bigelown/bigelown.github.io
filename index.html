      <h2>Assignment 2</h2>
        <p>This assignment was extremely difficult for me. I still do not fully understand how javascript interacts with html. I feel like I am guessing when I add some functionality to something. Every part of this assignment (that I could finish) took multiple hours to complete, and with a weekend gone from vaccine fever symptoms, I could not spread the work out over multiple days. Some useful resources were stack exchange and the code demos from lectures. The hardest part of this was adding a new twit. I could not figure out how to create a new complex element like the twit box, as I kept receiving cryptic errors that were not helpful in debugging. Instead I used the clone and replace function, which allowed me to replace the text of a twit element, but I could not figure out how to access the author as it was a link and time to submit was running out. Javascript sucks :( just use squarespace or something if you want to make a website. </p>
