      <h2>Assignment 4</h2>
        <p>This assignment was surprisingly difficult for me because I could not figure out how to get the .css files and .js files to run. I saw that the request was not being responded to in the error log, but I could not find any resources online that did not use “express.” Eventually after trial and error, I got it working, however, I assume that a better way would be through fs.readFileSync(). I also could not figure out how to create environment variables. There were very few helpful resources out there. My normal go-tos, Stack Exchange, W3 schools, Geeks for Geeks, where of very little help. The lectures also were pretty vague last week, so I could not rely on my notes. A few posts on campus wire were useful though.</p>
